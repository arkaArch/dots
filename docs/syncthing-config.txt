# Start and enable syncthing both machines:
sudo systemctl start syncthing@arka
sudo systemctl enable syncthing@arka 

# Provide username and password both devices:
Browser -> http://localhost:8384
Actions -> Setting -> GUI -> GUI Authenctication User -> GUI Authentication Password
Uncheck Start Browser

A default folder ~/Sync will be created. You can delete it by going 
=> Web Interface GUI -> Default Folder -> Edit -> Remove


Now if you try to connect desktop via gui(browser) from laptop by typing "http://192.168.0.119:8384" 
it doesn't connect since by default syncthing doesn't allow the service to be modified or controlled 
from outside the machine.
So to allow it, go to the file ~/.local/state/syncthing/config.xml of Desktop
Then go to <address> of <gui> section, and change it to 0.0.0.0:8384
