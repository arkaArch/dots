--------- Badblocks check ---------

# sudo badblocks -nsv -b 512 /dev/device

This test is designed for devices with data already on them. A non-destructive read-write test makes a backup of the original content of a sector before testing with a single random pattern and then restoring the content from the backup. This is a single pass test and is useful as a general maintenance test.

-n: Non-destructive read-write test. By default only a non-destructive read-only test is done.

-s: Show the progress of the scan by writing out rough percentage completion of the current badblocks pass over the  disk.

-v: Verbose mode. Will write the number of read errors, write errors and data- corruptions to stderr.

-b: Block size. Default block size is 1024. You can determined the block size of the disk by ---

$ lsblk -o NAME,PHY-SEC 
	
	
--------- Print files which match *.txt and are of size zero ---------
> $ find . -name '*.txt' -size 0


--------- Compress a folder with tar ---------
> tar -cJf archiveFileName.tar.xz directoryName

- c => Create a new tar archive
- J => Use the xz compression by calling the xz command
- f => Archive name
